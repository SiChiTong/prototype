# Skew-Symmetric Matrices

A skew-symmetric (or antisymmetric or antimetric) matrix is a square matrix
whose transpose is also its negative; that is, it satisfies the condition $−A =
A^{T}$. If the entry in the i-th row and j-th column is $a_{ij}$, i.e. $A =
(a_{ij})$ then the skew symmetric condition is $a_{ij} = −a_{ji}$. For example,
the following matrix is skew-symmetric:

\begin{equation}
    A =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & 2 & -1 \\
        -2 & 0 & -4 \\
        1 & 4 & 0
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
