# Model Predictive Control (MPC)

- Handles multi-varible control problems
- Takes account of actuator limitations
- Allows operation closer to constraints
- Control update rates are relatively low

In short MPC is a constraint-aware optimizing variety of predicitive control,
there is an easy-to-tune, intuitive variety which puts less emphasis on
constratitns and optimization , but more empahsis on simplicity and speed of
computation, and is particularly suitable for single-input single-output (SISO
problems).
